    "\n",

If the value in the column \"*spot_price*\" in the resulting dataframe \"*df_month*\" is higher than 1, the spot price is above the monthly average. If the value in the column \"*spot_price*\" in the resulting dataframe \"*df_month*\" is below 1, the spot price is below the monthly average. Please note that, for reasons of simplicity, we assign the category \"*below*\" to all spot prices that are equal to 1 as the question focuses on the ones above the monthly average. \n",
    "\n",
    "We create a summary table per month by summing up the values for the columns \"*above*\",\"*below*\" and \"*total*\" (which is the sum of \"*above*\" and \"*below*\") and use this dataframe to create the final dataframe called \"*df*\", where we show a summary for each month and append a line called \"*TOTAL SUM*\" with the yearly average of hours per month that are above the monthly average, which we highlight in blue.

    "The regression is done by using the function \"*polyfit*\", available in NumPy. The first two arguments are the two varibles x and y, e.g., \"*hydro*\" and \"*spot_price*\" in one of our cases. By setting the degree to **1**, we define that the output is a linear regression (and not a funtion of a higher degree like a parabola). The linear regression is a function of the type: y = ax+b, where a is the slope and b is the intersect with the y-axis.\n",
